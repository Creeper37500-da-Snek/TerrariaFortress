After... some amount of time? Hopefully it will have been worth the wait!

This mod is a small content mod in that it is not its own exact creation.
All of it revolves around the hit shooter Team Fortress 2 by Valve Corporation.

CURRENTLY FEATURES:
Pyro's Flamethrower, featuring afterburn and airblast as well as pvp compatability,
the stock shotgun, the fire axe, and Mann Co. ammunition! All sold from the Demoltionist post-Skeletron.

After Skeletron is defeated, celebrate Terraria's Fortress download milestones
with a special surprise from the Party Girl's shop!

TO BE ADDED:
Ms. Pauling NPC, Scout and Soldier stock weapons.

Stay tuned! Note this mod is *VERY* much in a work in progress state, so please
report any and all bugs to Pyroknight#1787 through dms on the TModLoader official discord.
